I built the basics of the ForkedLightning function, need to add in a way to get a random target, get the action added to the controller and to a character,
then test it in production

There may be some code here that I can re use for area effect spells



Next up:

--Create selection pagination function (should this be based on DB records or images)?
~~Considerations:   ~~What are the advantages of pagination of attachments instead of a drop down?
                    ~~A: Images and displaying more information
~~Use cases:    ~~choosing avatar image: need to paginate through images, these don't tie to DB records
                ~~Character rankings?  That way you can see a mini avatar and see buttons like (Inspect)
                ~~Zone list - is DB based
                ~~Possibly a shop if you want to see stats and a "purchase" button without having to inspect
                ~~Class selection - is DB based
~~Requirements: ~~Should be flexible to accomodate array of values, whether those are DB records or images from file
                ~~Should include back and forward buttons
~~Questions:    ~~How will pagination state be handled?  I.E: display records 1-6, how does "forward" button know to pull records 7-12 & where are those records stored locally?



--Clean up views: profile (add exit button) - Exit button should be reusable and clear any interaction - ask slack what I can do for this
--Change images in class selection list - maybe class icons
--check that profile, inventory, equipped, equiping and shopping mechanics all still work
--refactor get action call to move into its own function or file
--refactor slackRequest file - make it able to be tested with unit tests, make it easier to follow
--create game refresh mechanic - working

Backlog (near term):
--vendor sell item mechanic


Backlog (long term):
--Use canvas or something like it to combine images rendered on the server and deliver that image to slack.  I.E inventory image with empty slots.
equip an item, then next time the image renders it will contain the item image equipped
--Questing mechanic using EQ style context terms: "Have you heard about [the missing child] from the town of beladore?"
--Generate .gif images to show animations in slack
