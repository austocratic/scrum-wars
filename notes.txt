Where I left off 10/9/18:

--Left off adding a new action Krom's smithy

Next up:

--BUG: actions clearing from the queue often clear the wrong action:
----Cast a delayed action then cast a instant action - delayed actions is incorrectly cleared and instanct action stays in queue.  Finds wrong queue ID
----Bug research:
----When second action is added to the queue, it got added with turn initiated as the next turn, but had an undefined "last turn processed value"
----ACtion queue .filter checks the last turn processed value of each action in the queue
----action queue appears to be correctly finding the right action to remove from queue.  Issue must be in _deleteActionInQueue function
----_deleteActionInQueue iterates through the queue looking for the right action to delete, it finds the right action to delete
----issue seems to be in _deleteActionInQueue() .splice call

BACKLOG:

Backlog (near term):
--Split town up into 2 vendors:
----Winston's Curiosities (more expensive items, more magic related)
----Krom's Smithy (Basic armor, weapons)
--Add more items
--XP mechanic:
----Participating in arena match (earns a little XP)
----Winning arena match (earns a lot of XP)
----Completing tradeskills
--level up mechanic:
----In refresh()
--scrumdo integration.
----Update users table to store scrumdo account ID
----Add DB table/fields to store scrumdo cards
----Refresh mechanic should check scrumdo to see if card status = complete
----Scrumdo should power "tradeskill".
----Completing tradeskill "tasks" should add xp and notify the character.
----In the future: completing tasks should earn trade points.  Tradepoints can be redeemed for items which can be sold for gold
----In the future: access tradeskills via "workshop" option in the town

BUGS:
-Attack evasion response times out (but still posts team message in slack)
-Melee attack strike back can have some weird effects.  I think sometimes the player context can get switched..... If you kill a character with a melee attack and then use /action it registers as if you are the character that was killed
-Poisoned blade response times out when target dodges
-CHeck for match start is off by 1 hour.  At 8:40am it was logging "hour of 7 is less than 9, don't start the match"
-Using an action and failing (such as stumble) do not reduce characters action points is that ok?
-Entering a combat stance does not remove previous combat stance
--Creating a new user sets slack_user_id equal to the user object id
--Equipping minor staff correctly sets the DB but displays a "an item is already equipped" message - likely because of 2handed

Backlog (long term):
--Possibly reorganize actions into 5 attachment blocks each with a picture and a button for more information.  The 5 current actions can be equipped from a characters menu.  In the future, I can create hotkey /commands to initiate your loaded action
--endpoint authentication to verify source was slack
--A way to see all your actions and more advanced details of each action
--Change whirlwind so that it does damage to everyone for several turns.  If action character is hit during this time it interrupts.  Cant take other actions
--Change announcement of team battle to saw who is on what team
--Add to /rankings inspect buttons to look at each character
-Make a standard travel function so that checkForCharacterDeath and /travel can share
-Only allow actions in arena if there is an active match
----Or change the action list to not combat actions
--Change images in class selection list - maybe class icons
--vendor sell item mechanic
--Add armor limitations, certain classes can wear certain armor
--Support for summoned pets - these should add a pet character to the character's team.  Typing /action should have a row with pet's abilities
-BUG evading an attack still triggers strike_back
--Prevent traveling until character has set their name
-Prevent /name after initial naming
--Add a contextual image to actions screens
--Add an icon for scrum-wars application
--Add token validation before processing any request
--Make BasicMelee show text specific to the type of weapon being held
--Quest system.  Talking to a character will respond with dialogue options.  Navigating through dialogue can initiate a quest.  When quest is accomplished they receive a message and reward
----I.E: travel to the arena
--create titles for menus (using an edited graphic menu header)
--Change to action point system (AP recharges per turn)
--Create basic attack for each character class
-----Should depend on equipped weapon's damage
--Fix hiding/stealth mechanic
----It should probably be added into character effects - In the future, I will list a character's effects
--Create a single action mapping file that can be used by actionQueue & selectActionTarget
--Use canvas or something like it to combine images rendered on the server and deliver that image to slack.  I.E inventory image with empty slots.
equip an item, then next time the image renders it will contain the item image equipped
--Questing mechanic using EQ style context terms: "Have you heard about [the missing child] from the town of beladore?"
--Create frozen barrier action
--Fix poisoned blade effect.  Need to leverage action processor and remove actionEffectControllers completely



Plot/Quest brainstorming:

"Tithes of _____"

King died and you have traveled to pay your respects.
