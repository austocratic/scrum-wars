Where I left off 10/28/18:

--Left off trying to implement slack dialogue menus.  I cant get it to work though.  It responds and posts the dialogue JSON into slack body
--I think I fixed the issue with processTradeskills, I need to push & test.
--I left off, processTradeSkills finally filters the cards correctly.  Now I need to write to the DB

Next up:



BACKLOG:

Backlog (near term):
--Level up mechanic should do other stuff (increase stat points, allow access to other actions, ect.)
--Add more items
--XP mechanic:
----Participating in arena match (earns a little XP)
----Winning arena match (earns a lot of XP)
----Completing tradeskills
--scrumdo integration.
----For first version, I will call scrumdo api every minute using the scheduler.  I should not put the funcitonality in refresh()
----Update users table to store scrumdo account ID
----Add DB table/fields to store scrumdo cards
----Refresh mechanic should check scrumdo to see if card status = complete
----Scrumdo should power "tradeskill".
----Completing tradeskill "tasks" should add xp and notify the character.
----In the future: completing tasks should earn trade points.  Tradepoints can be redeemed for items which can be sold for gold
----In the future: access tradeskills via "workshop" option in the town or "trade guild"
--TODO
1) Make new town action "Crafters Guild" - opens a dialogue menu

BUGS:
-starting a team match with only one character can have issues.  Random team assignment can place the character on team 2, so team array is missing element 0
-Melee attack strike back can have some weird effects.  I think sometimes the player context can get switched..... If you kill a character with a melee attack and then use /action it registers as if you are the character that was killed
-CHeck for match start is off by 1 hour.  At 8:40am it was logging "hour of 7 is less than 9, don't start the match"
-Using an action and failing (such as stumble) do not reduce characters action points is that ok?
-Entering a combat stance does not remove previous combat stance
--Creating a new user sets slack_user_id equal to the user object id
--Equipping minor staff correctly sets the DB but displays a "an item is already equipped" message - likely because of 2handed

Backlog (long term):
--Possibly reorganize actions into 5 attachment blocks each with a picture and a button for more information.  The 5 current actions can be equipped from a characters menu.  In the future, I can create hotkey /commands to initiate your loaded action
--endpoint authentication to verify source was slack
--A way to see all your actions and more advanced details of each action
--Change whirlwind so that it does damage to everyone for several turns.  If action character is hit during this time it interrupts.  Cant take other actions
--Change announcement of team battle to saw who is on what team
--Add to /rankings inspect buttons to look at each character
-Make a standard travel function so that checkForCharacterDeath and /travel can share
-Only allow actions in arena if there is an active match
----Or change the action list to not combat actions
--Change images in class selection list - maybe class icons
--vendor sell item mechanic
--Add armor limitations, certain classes can wear certain armor
--Support for summoned pets - these should add a pet character to the character's team.  Typing /action should have a row with pet's abilities
-BUG evading an attack still triggers strike_back
--Prevent traveling until character has set their name
-Prevent /name after initial naming
--Add a contextual image to actions screens
--Add an icon for scrum-wars application
--Add token validation before processing any request
--Make BasicMelee show text specific to the type of weapon being held
--Quest system.  Talking to a character will respond with dialogue options.  Navigating through dialogue can initiate a quest.  When quest is accomplished they receive a message and reward
----I.E: travel to the arena
--create titles for menus (using an edited graphic menu header)
--Change to action point system (AP recharges per turn)
--Create basic attack for each character class
-----Should depend on equipped weapon's damage
--Fix hiding/stealth mechanic
----It should probably be added into character effects - In the future, I will list a character's effects
--Create a single action mapping file that can be used by actionQueue & selectActionTarget
--Use canvas or something like it to combine images rendered on the server and deliver that image to slack.  I.E inventory image with empty slots.
equip an item, then next time the image renders it will contain the item image equipped
--Questing mechanic using EQ style context terms: "Have you heard about [the missing child] from the town of beladore?"
--Create frozen barrier action
--Fix poisoned blade effect.  Need to leverage action processor and remove actionEffectControllers completely



Plot/Quest brainstorming:

"Tithes of _____"

King died and you have traveled to pay your respects.
